## **Enact: Frequently Asked Questions**

### ❓ **Why a protocol? As opposed to a centralized MCP tool server?**

**Answer:**
A protocol ensures **portability, interoperability, and decentralization**. By standardizing how tools are defined and executed, Enact enables:

* Easy integration with any agent or system.
* Tool reuse across different environments.
* Community growth via open contributions and private registries.

A centralized tool server limits flexibility. Enact lets teams define, share, and trust tools—without lock-in.

### ❓ **Does MCP have plans to provide something similar?**

**Answer:**
Not directly. MCP (Multi-Component Protocol) focuses on message routing and tool orchestration. It **doesn’t define tools or how they execute**. Enact complements MCP by offering:

* Structured tool schemas.
* Execution runtimes.
* Discovery mechanisms and validation.

Together, they make a powerful stack—but Enact fills a **distinct, missing layer**.

### ❓ **Why not just integrate with MCP protocol and work with their team?**

**Answer:**
We are MCP-compatible by design. Enact tools can be used in any MCP-aware system.
However, our broader mission is to:

* **Define a neutral, protocol-first standard** for tool discovery and execution.
* Provide a **registry, validation, and signing system** that supports open and private usage.
* Build tooling (e.g. compilers, IDE extensions) that simplify adoption across ecosystems—not just MCP.

We’re happy to collaborate, but Enact stands on its own.

### ❓ **How do you expect to build up more tools?**

**Answer:**
We’ll expand the ecosystem by:

* **Dogfooding:** Publishing reusable tools we use ourselves.
* **Open Source Registry:** Letting developers publish, sign, and discover tools publicly.
* **CLI & Compiler Tools:** Enabling devs to easily convert scripts or prompts into Enact documents.
* **Hosted Registries:** Offering companies private registries with support and subscriptions.

We’re making tool creation as easy as writing a YAML file.

### ❓ **What problem are you solving?**

**Answer:**
The agent ecosystem lacks a **standard for reusable, verifiable tools**. Today’s tools are:

* Ad hoc scripts with unclear interfaces.
* Not portable or composable.
* Hard to discover or trust.

**Enact solves this by providing:**

* A structured protocol for defining and validating tools.
* A discovery registry and signing system.
* Execution support across runtimes and infrastructures.

Think of Enact as **npm for AI agents**—but protocol-native, trustable, and designed for collaboration.
